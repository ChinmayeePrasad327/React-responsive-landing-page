## 🤖 Introduction

This project showcases a responsive landing page layout built in React using utility-first Tailwind CSS. The goal was to practice building components that look great at every screen size — from mobile to desktop — while keeping the codebase modular and easy to maintain.

This isn’t just a static page; it’s a frontend experiment that reinforces responsive design, React component architecture, and working with modern CSS frameworks in a real deployment.
